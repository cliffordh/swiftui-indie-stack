## Our Philosophy

This template is for developers who'd rather spend energy on what makes their app unique — not reinventing authentication, subscriptions, and analytics for the hundredth time.

---

## What's Included

### Offline-First Architecture
Your app works seamlessly offline. Data is stored locally first, with optional cloud sync when Firebase is enabled.

### Subscription Management
Pre-integrated RevenueCat for painless in-app purchases. Just add your API key and you're ready to monetize.

### Streak System
Gamify your app with the built-in streak tracking system. Includes home screen and lock screen widgets to keep users engaged.

### Library/CMS
This very screen! A GitHub-based content management system lets you publish articles without app updates.

### Analytics
Privacy-preserving analytics with TelemetryDeck. No PII collected, GDPR-friendly out of the box.

---

## Two Modes

### Local Mode (Default)
- No Firebase account required
- Device-based identity
- UserDefaults storage
- Perfect for prototyping or simple apps

### Cloud Mode
- Full Firebase Auth (Apple, Google, Email sign-in)
- Firestore data sync
- Cloud-calculated streaks
- Crashlytics error reporting

Switch between modes with a single flag in `AppConfiguration.swift`.
